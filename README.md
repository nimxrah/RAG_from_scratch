# RAG_from_scratch
RAG from Scratch is an end-to-end implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built using open-source tools. The project demonstrates how to ground language-model responses in custom documents by combining semantic embeddings, vector search, and controlled text generation, without relying on high-level RAG frameworks.
